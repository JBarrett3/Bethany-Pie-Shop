<!--

This is my second html. Today we are working on style.

New:
1. You can put in  a style and then a div{} in head
This leads to many options including color
2. Rules: In the style we put in rules
That is to mean that h1{} dictates how all h1's look
Same goes for h2 and everything else
3. Classes are a way to create text with a
non-comforming style. just put ."classname" in the 
style definitions and then put class="classname" in
the usage
4. Other possibilities: background-color,width
